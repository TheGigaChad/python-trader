V0.01
    - Started doing stuff

V0.02
    - doing more stuff

V0.08
    The version where I try and keep better documentation.  Also includes foundational work to facilitate using
    Machine Learning models and Training into the project.  Yay!
    - Added Model Manager
            This is responsible for handling all model interactions including
                - retrieving models from local stores
                - push/pull models to AWS
                - creating models
    - Added tests for Model Manager interactions.
            Since AWS tests are encompassed by this, I will need to create some new generic tests.
    - Added Training Manager
            This will be how we interact with the training of our models.
            Both the Model Manager and the Trading Manager will inherit this and use it to train or evaluate our
            potenital trades and model accuracy.
    - Added Training Instances
            These will be the individual training instances for each stock, completing training tasks and keeping track
            of the status.

V0.09
    - Added simple training tests
